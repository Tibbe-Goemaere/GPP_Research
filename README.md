# GPP_Research : Npc awareness in a stealth game

# Why?

We want to make the AI in stealth games feel believable, if you want to distract a guard with a coin or making a sound you don't want all guards to come investigate it. This would make it way harder for the player to move unnoticed and it would make no sense, why would all guards come investigate some small distraction?

# Interests

In a stealth game there are multiple types of interests. If you take assassins creed for example, in the game you can shoot a barrel to make an explosion or whistle at guards. Both of these actions will distract
