# GPP_Research : How to catch a ninja, npc awareness in a 2d stealth platformer game

# Why?

We want to make the AI in stealth games feel believable, if you want to distract a guard with a coin or making a sound you don't want all guards to come investigate it. This would make it way harder for the player to move unnoticed and it would make no sense, why would all guards come investigate some small distraction?
